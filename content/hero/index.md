I am a graduate student pursuing Masters in Computer Science at Arizona State University. 

I have worked as a Software Engineer at Aruba Networks for 3 years as a full-stack developer, and I am well-versed in Python, C++, Docker, Kubernetes,
ML frameworks, and Linux along with an in-depth understanding of SQL/NoSQL databases software systems.
